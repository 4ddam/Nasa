/*
 * This project is to demonstrate the HAS-A and IS-A relationships.
 * Design an Astroknot class with several instance variables including name, weight, fitnessLevel and currentPlanet.
 * The Astroknot will also have several actions it can perform.
 * At the minimum he/she should be able to jump, eat, rest and exercise. 
 * Note that the fitnessLevel will increase along with a decrease in weight when he/she exercises. 
 * Rest could also have an influence on the fitness level. 
 * Similarly when the astroknot Jumps itâ€™s weight , currentPlanet and fitnessLevel will affect the height of 
 * the jump. For example Dr. Grateful on the moon will be able to jump much higher 
 * than Mr. Mela on Earth even though they have similar fitnessLevels;) 
 * (I know the moon is not a planet!!) Next you will need to create a class called Planet 
 * that creates planet objects that have name, diameter, mass and gravity. Remember 
 * all of the variables will need to be private so that they may not be changed.
 * 
 * Finally make a client to demonstrate the different aspects of the Astroknot. 
 * Send the astroknot to different planets, make them exercise, sleep and jump. Have fun with it!!!
